    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2026</p>

    <p>
      TimeDraft is a Chrome extension that helps users generate and insert
      calendar availability into Gmail drafts. This privacy policy explains
      how TimeDraft accesses, uses, stores, and protects Google user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Accessed</h2>
    <p>
      TimeDraft accesses the following Google user data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Calendar data (read-only)</strong>, including event
        start and end times, to determine when a user is available.
      </li>
      <li>
        Basic account information provided by Google during OAuth
        authentication (such as an email address or profile identifier).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
    <p>
      Google user data is used solely to provide the core functionality of
      TimeDraft. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Calendar data is processed to calculate available time windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generated availability is displayed to the user for insertion into
        Gmail drafts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      TimeDraft does <strong>not</strong> use Google user data for advertising,
      analytics, marketing, or training machine learning models.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      TimeDraft does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share Google user data
      with third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data is only transmitted between the extension and Google APIs as
      required to retrieve calendar availability.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>
      TimeDraft does not store Google Calendar event data on external servers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        OAuth access tokens are stored locally in the user’s browser using
        Chrome extension storage.
      </li>
      <li>
        All communication with Google APIs occurs over secure HTTPS
        connections.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      TimeDraft retains Google user data only for as long as necessary to
      provide its functionality.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Calendar data is processed in real time and is not persistently saved.
      </li>
      <li>
        OAuth tokens remain stored locally until the user disconnects the
        extension or removes it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Users can delete all data associated with TimeDraft at any time by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removing the TimeDraft Chrome extension from their browser</li>
      <li>
        Revoking TimeDraft’s access in their Google Account under
        <em>Security → Third-party access</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
